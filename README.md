# ‚ú® Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, managed with `stow` and a custom installer script.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Install XCode Command Line Tools:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

   If you encounter an error, you can also try:

   ```bash

   ```

   This step is necessary to ensure that the required build tools are available.

2. **Install Homebrew and Git:**

   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && brew install git

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rdrkr/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

4. **Navigate to the repository:**

   ```bash
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ```
